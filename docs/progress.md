# JARI Frontend Progress

## Module 1/2 architecture synchronization — completed 2026-11-13

Before beginning Module 1 application changes, the complete available development-plan folder was reviewed: `JARI_Module_1_Updated.md` and `JARI_Module_2_Updated.md`. README, frontend progress/handoff documents, current frontend documentation, and the relevant auth, dashboard, farm form, service-facade and simulated-data implementation were inspected.

- Added [architecture.md](architecture.md) as the canonical shared product/data architecture and linked it from the README. It records Farm → Houses → Batches, record ownership, aggregation, connected/independent capabilities, module boundaries, and the difference between current simulation and target contracts.
- The two plans agree that Module 1 is frontend/mock only and must stop at primary-farm onboarding; Module 2 owns house/flock/inventory workflows. Module 2 permits flock and inventory to operate independently. Later production/health functions extend shared batch identities, and institution workflows follow the farmer/farm foundation.
- Existing code has a service facade and browser-local simulated workflows for farm profile, houses, flocks/movements, feed/inventory, production and health. These are implemented to varying levels; existing progress/handoff files list validation separately. No claim is made that all plan requirements are implemented or backend connected.
- Main gap: current farmer auth and farm profile persistence are legacy-shaped; the profile is a single shared record and several operational records lack complete account/farm ownership. Module 1 therefore needs account-scoped onboarding records and an atomic completion service, while preserving demo seed behavior and migrating legacy data safely. GPS/geocoding provider is absent; browser geolocation plus manual farm-location entry is the plan-compatible implementation.
- A sequencing ambiguity remains in Module 2: it describes house management as the operational foundation, while a later restriction defers some house-management implementation pending separate authorization. This does not block Module 1 and will be respected when Module 2 is taken up. No owner decision is needed for Module 1.
- Module 1 scope remains exactly account/contact-verification demo, resumable setup, farmer profile, primary farm, review and dashboard activation. No backend, migrations, house/batch records, inventory or production work is authorized by this phase.

**Gate result:** architecture synchronization is recorded; Module 1 implementation may proceed within the boundary above.

### Module 1 implementation — in progress

- Expanded farmer registration to first/last name, email, phone, password, confirmation and privacy acceptance. The current interface clearly states that contact-verification messages are not sent because no email/SMS verification provider is configured. Existing backend registration still accepts phone/name/password; email is retained with this browser's onboarding record pending a backend contract change in a separately authorized phase.
- Added account-keyed onboarding records through the shared simulated-data/service layers. Profile, farm identity, farm location/GPS metadata, infrastructure, farm membership/primary-farm IDs, onboarding state and timestamps have explicit logical boundaries. Onboarding completion is saved in one account record; browser-storage write errors leave completion unset.
- Added a resumable five-step farmer profile, farm identity, location, poultry/infrastructure and review flow. Location permission is user initiated; typed coordinates and administrative/address details remain available as fallback. Capacity/current-bird validation and conditional CAC entry are included.
- New farmer dashboards block operational figures until setup is complete, then show the registered primary farm and genuine empty state with an Inventory Setup action. Logout now preserves all browser-local farmer data rather than deleting every account's records.
- Backend, migrations, house records, flock records, inventory operations and other later-module workflows were not changed.
- Remaining before Module 1 completion: optional profile-photo support, more complete location and numeric edge-case validation, account/email behavior across backend sign-in, alignment of legacy operational screens with account-scoped farms, interrupted-flow review, responsive/browser review, and documented verification. No tests or builds have been run in this pass.

### Auth viewport regression fix

- Added the standing no-overflow rule to `active.md` and the frontend responsive-design requirements: auth pages must fit the viewport without clipping/scrolling or hiding required fields/actions; validate all account types on mobile and desktop after auth changes.
- Reworked farmer signup as two progressive steps (contact details, then password/consent), preserving entries and providing Back/Continue actions. This reduces the content shown at once while retaining comfortable field spacing and a visible primary action.
- Visual/browser validation has not been run in this pass.
- Auth validation, API and upload errors now use the global fixed toast viewport rather than inline blocks, preventing error states from shifting the form card or submit action. Native constraint feedback is routed through toast notifications as well.

### Signup form refinement

- Refined the two-step signup into a contained registration card with labeled progress, clearer section hierarchy and intentional spacing.
- Added real Lucide icons for step state, password checklist state and navigation. The live password checklist reflects the backend's six-character minimum and confirmation match, with guidance to choose a memorable phrase unique to JARI.
- Removed duplicate signup and step headings, and placed the account-type label alongside its selector to reduce unnecessary vertical height while preserving field spacing.
- Kept the signup fields and primary action within the no-overflow auth layout rule. Browser review is still outstanding.

## Phase 8: Landing page redesign

Status: Implemented and pending review

### Completed
- Replaced the prior marketing layout with a shorter, plain-language introduction to JARI.
- Focused the hero on one clear action: create a farm profile, with sign-in as the secondary action.
- Used a Nigerian poultry-house photo and added visible photographer, source and license attribution.
- Reduced the page to a simple three-step explanation and one closing call to action.
- Preserved the existing `/register` and `/login` routes.

### Files changed
- [frontend/src/app/page.tsx](frontend/src/app/page.tsx)

### Validation
- `git diff --check` completed without whitespace errors.
- Build and browser review have not been run.

### Next step
- Review this landing page direction before applying the new design across the remaining frontend routes.

## Phase 9: Product story and visual explanation

Status: Implemented and pending review

### Completed
- Reworked the headline and intro to explain JARI as a clearer farm picture that helps farmers understand risk and explore suitable support.
- Reframed the landing page around JARI's actual sequence: farm records → farm profile and risk areas → practical advice and finance/insurance options.
- Built a responsive product illustration with real farm context, record types, risk/profile outcomes and support options. The central profile is visually emphasized to make JARI's role clear.
- Kept the page short, with one primary registration action and a compact closing action.
- Verified the image depicts broilers, feeders and a brooder in an indoor poultry space in Kano, Nigeria. Added required author, source, resize and CC BY-SA 4.0 credit.

### Files changed
- [frontend/src/app/page.tsx](frontend/src/app/page.tsx)

### Validation
- `git diff --check` completed without whitespace errors.
- Build and browser review have not been run.

### Next step
- Review whether the illustrated product story explains JARI clearly before extending this direction to other routes.

## Phase 10: Borderless visual system

Status: Implemented and pending review

### Completed
- Added a global no-outline surface rule so existing page cards, list rows, buttons and banners no longer render visible borders.
- Changed text inputs and selects to use a soft filled surface; checkbox/radio outlines and keyboard focus rings remain visible for usability.
- Simplified role workspace navigation to use the page background and spacing instead of bordered, boxed shells.
- Removed border styling from the landing page and made its farm flow rely on imagery, fill, spacing and a single emphasized JARI panel.

## Phase 11: Poultry hero direction

Status: Hero layout implemented; refreshed photo pending

### Completed
- Reworked the landing hero into a full-width poultry-house photo background with a dark green gradient for readable text.
- Kept the message short and farmer-focused, with one primary action.
- Removed the photo card from the product flow so the explanation stays focused on farm records → JARI profile → support.
- Moved the existing photo credit out of the image card and into the footer.

### Files changed
- [frontend/src/app/page.tsx](frontend/src/app/page.tsx)
- [frontend/src/components/landing/farm-journey.tsx](frontend/src/components/landing/farm-journey.tsx)

### Photo follow-up
- The current licensed Nigeria farm image is still being used in the hero. A better Wikimedia Commons candidate was identified, but Wikimedia returned HTTP 429 when downloading it, so its appearance could not be inspected. The image-generation tool is not available in this session.
- Keep the existing Wikimedia author, file and CC BY-SA 4.0 attribution visible in the footer until a replacement is verified.

### Validation
- Build and browser review have not been run.

### Next step

- Redesigned the auth shell with a compact mobile photo banner, account switcher, clearer support path and reusable JARI styling.
- Replaced the inactive password-reset form with clear account-support contact options because no reset API is configured.
- Changed the mobile dashboard hamburger into a left-sliding navigation drawer with backdrop, scroll lock, Escape and outside-click close, and close-on-route-change behavior.
- Grouped farmer, admin and institutional navigation into collapsible sections and kept the workspace header sticky while scrolling.
- Applied shared visual treatment to dashboard form cards, inputs, selects, textareas, focus states and submit buttons.
- Rebuilt farmer dashboard KPI cards with clearer hierarchy, illustrative-data labels and a direct farm-profile summary.
- Improved quick actions to link to existing record routes and made the farm profile directly reachable from the dashboard and farmer avatar.
- Reworked the farm profile into readable identity, operation, housing and biosecurity sections with an edit path.

### Validation
- `git diff --check` only; no build, tests or browser review.

### Next step
- Add the team's actual names, roles and headshots; review the layouts at phone and desktop widths.

## Phase 22: Farmer dashboard clarity and farm review

Status: Implemented; responsive review and backend integration remain

### Completed
- Simplified the farmer dashboard to farm details, clear next steps and a readable review status. Removed unsupported sample KPIs and activity claims.
- Added a farmer onboarding tour shown on the first dashboard visit, with skip, next, finish and Escape controls.
- Added a KYC farm review form for farm name, location and phone number, with pending, verified and more-details states.
- Added an admin verification page where a reviewer can inspect the submitted farm details, mark a farm verified or request more information.
- Replaced fabricated risk ratings and assessment claims with a transparent farm risk profile explaining that JARI has not issued an assessment before a review.
- Added a direct farm risk profile action to the farmer's farm page.
- Reworded farmer navigation in plain language and added farm verification to the menu.
- Updated the mobile navigation to cover the viewport and animate both in and out; added thin desktop scrollbars that are hidden on mobile.

### Implementation limitation
- KYC submissions and review decisions currently use browser local storage because the project has no server-backed KYC or risk-assessment endpoint. Farmer and reviewer views do not sync across different devices or browsers; connect the flow to authenticated backend storage before real use.

### Validation
- `git diff --check` only. No build, tests or browser review.

## Phase 23: Farmer dashboard interactions

Status: Implemented; responsive browser review remains

### Completed
- Changed the notification bell to open the latest four notifications in a dropdown. Each item expands to show its details, and View all opens the full notification page.
- Made each notification on the full page expandable.
- Hid the "Your farm / Farmer workspace" title block on mobile while keeping the logo and controls.
- Replaced the generic tour popup with a responsive spotlight around the exact farm shortcut, menu/navigation control, and a page action.
- Made farm house cards open a complete known-details panel and bird group cards open flock details.
- Made farm equipment cards open a detail panel with an edit form for name, quantity, value, condition and notes.
- Reworded the birds and farm houses pages with simpler labels, removed the unsupported mortality metric, and renamed Messages to Notifications.
- Reduced the desktop WebKit scrollbar width to 3px; it stays hidden on mobile.
- Hid the farm review form after a successful submission and showed an animated checkmark confirmation.

### Validation
- `git diff --check` only; no build, tests or browser review.

## Phase 24: Persistent simulated farm workflows

Status: Core workflows implemented; complete frontend acceptance checklist remains in `active.md`.

### Completed
- Added versioned browser storage with migration of legacy demo records and a shared change event for refreshing other open screens.
- Expanded the central simulated data layer and API-shaped service facade for farm profile, poultry houses, flocks/movements, feed purchases/use, production, health, sales, expenses, assets, verification and activity.
- Added shared validation for house capacity, flock movements, feed stock, production records and sale/expense records.
- Connected production, sales, expenses and equipment creation forms to simulated records and updated production/sales/expense lists and totals to reflect saved data.
- Replaced fabricated analytics metrics with saved sales, feed purchase and egg production records and responsive charts.
- Made the reports action download a farm record snapshot.
- Preserved the prior notification, spotlight tour, details/edit, KYC success and scrollbar improvements.
- Rewrote `active.md` as a handoff checklist with verified completed scope, remaining workflows, validation and next tasks.

### Validation
- `npm run build` passed after the analytics, reports and health screens; all 41 routes generated. Tailwind reports an existing ambiguous custom easing class warning.
- `git diff --check` passed (line-ending normalization notices only).
- `npm run lint` stopped at Next.js's first-run ESLint setup prompt; the project has no ESLint config. No test runner is configured. Automated workflows and browser responsive review still need to run.
- No backend code was changed.

### Next step
- Complete and validate health CRUD/mortality and financial payment workflows, then finish document and opportunity simulations. Follow `active.md` for the full ordered backlog.

### Phase 24 follow-up
- Replaced static vaccination and incident screens with local simulated record forms and live lists. The build validates these forms; recorded losses decrement the flock through the movement ledger.
- Added shared, validated actions to collect a sale's remaining balance or pay an expense's remaining balance. The records and totals update immediately. Partial amounts and payment history remain on the checklist.
- Added locally persisted opportunity tracking, farmer contact/preferences/backup settings, and shared-data admin/institution views for all current sidebar destinations.
- Added a no-dependency workflow test command covering legacy storage migration, flock population changes, feed stock validation/updates, payment balance validation/settlement and malformed backup rejection; all five tests pass.
- Added local farm-document uploads with stored contents/metadata, preview, download and remove actions; included documents/preferences/opportunity state in backup snapshots.
- Added backup import confirmation and upfront section validation, plus role-correct admin/institution action links.
- `npm run build` passed after these additions and generated all 42 routes.
