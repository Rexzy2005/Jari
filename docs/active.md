# JARI Frontend Implementation Tracker

## Current development plan: Module 1

Architecture synchronization is complete and recorded in `progress.md` and `architecture.md`. Farmer onboarding is actively being implemented through browser-local simulated services. Current work includes required account contact fields, resumable profile/farm registration, separate farm location metadata, user-initiated GPS with manual fallback, review and an honest post-onboarding dashboard. This work does not include backend changes or house/batch/inventory implementation. Consult the Module 1 entry in `progress.md` for gaps and limitations; the older checklist below tracks the broader pre-existing frontend work.

## Standing auth layout rule

Auth pages must fit the available viewport without clipping, page scrolling, or hidden controls at any supported viewport size. Every form field and primary action must remain visible and reachable. When a flow is too long, split it into clear steps before reducing the design's spacing. Show validation and account-level errors in the global toast layer so messages never change form height. Never solve overflow by hiding or clipping required fields or the submit button. Check both sign-in and every registration account type on desktop and mobile after auth changes.

This tracker continues the work in `frontend-fix.md`. The application is frontend-only: use simulated services and browser storage; do not add or change backend code.

## Current status

**In progress.** Persistent demo data and several core farm-record workflows are implemented. The latest frontend production build passes. Full acceptance criteria in `frontend-fix.md` are not complete yet; remaining items are listed below so the next developer can continue without re-auditing completed work.

## Completed in this pass

- [x] Added a versioned `jari-demo:v1:` local-storage namespace with one-time migration from existing unversioned demo records. Writes emit `jari:mock-data-changed` for cross-screen refresh.
- [x] Centralized simulated records, validation and CRUD helpers in `frontend/src/lib/simulated-data.ts`; exposed a backend-replaceable facade in `frontend/src/services/index.ts`.
- [x] Added farm record models and shared state for flock populations/movements, farm houses, feed purchases/use and stock, production, vaccinations, health incidents, sales, expenses, assets, KYC and activity.
- [x] Added validations for flock movement, house capacity/archiving, feed stock, production and financial record creation.
- [x] Connected feed purchase/use, flock creation/movements, house creation/edit/archive, and the production, sale, expense and asset forms to persistent simulated records.
- [x] Replaced production, sales and expense summaries with values from the records; added cross-screen refresh through the shared storage event.
- [x] Replaced invented analytics values with actual saved sales, feed-purchase and egg-production data; added responsive charts.
- [x] Replaced the inactive reports button with a downloadable farm-record snapshot.
- [x] Replaced static vaccination and health-incident screens with persistent create forms, record lists, validation and clear empty states. Recorded mortality updates the flock population through the movement ledger.
- [x] Added validated full-balance collection and expense-payment actions that update shared sales/expense records.
- [x] Added persistent saved-opportunity status tracking with preparation guidance and explicit local-only messaging.
- [x] Connected farmer contact settings, reminder/analytics preferences and local data backup to persistent simulated storage.
- [x] Added local farm-document upload, persisted file metadata/content, download and remove actions with a 1.5 MB size limit.
- [x] Added backup import confirmation and pre-write validation so malformed sections are rejected before any farm data is changed.
- [x] Added useful admin/institution catch-all views for every existing sidebar destination, with shared demo farm/review summaries and clear local-simulation limitations.
- [x] Added five no-dependency workflow tests for legacy storage migration, bird-count updates, feed inventory, financial payment balances and safe backup validation.
- [x] Preserved the earlier notification detail/preview, dashboard tour spotlight, house/flock/asset detail-edit, KYC confirmation, and slim scrollbar work.
- [x] Updated this file with remaining tasks and execution order.

## Remaining implementation checklist

### P0 — Complete and verify core farm workflows

- [ ] Read the remaining detailed acceptance criteria in `frontend-fix.md` sections 4–25 and confirm each route against them.
- [ ] Add partial-payment entry and payment history; keep outstanding balances consistent with sales/expense records.
- [ ] Add health-record edit/delete and treatment records; review mortality edge cases and ensure mortality is reflected once in flock counts.
- [ ] Ensure flock transfers update both source and destination populations and preserve a movement history.
- [ ] Finish asset edit/delete edge cases; review document previews, browser-storage quota handling and import/export edge cases.
- [ ] Persist opportunity applications and statuses (initial save/checklist tracking is done); add detailed eligibility and an admin review management view.
- [ ] Complete farm profile/business report generation in a readable downloadable format (the current report snapshot is JSON).
- [ ] Ensure all record lists refresh after create/update/delete and show useful empty, error and success states.
- [ ] Expand backup import validation to every record-field schema and add clear rollback handling for storage quota/write failures.

### P1 — Product-wide consistency and roles

- [ ] Review auth, session persistence, registration, password-recovery explanation and role guards against demo accounts in `frontend-fix.md`.
- [ ] Finish farmer dashboard and risk/financial assessments using only available demo data; clearly label any illustrative or not-yet-assessed result.
- [ ] Replace remaining static/fabricated values in farmer dashboard and other screens with shared demo data or explicit empty states.
- [ ] Complete admin/institution verification, opportunity, report and partner workflows in local simulation; preserve role restrictions and provide visible outcomes.
- [ ] Make notification/activity records consistent with user actions and ensure notification links open their relevant pages.
- [ ] Add a dedicated demo-data reset confirmation; settings contact/preferences/backup import/export are implemented.
- [ ] Review all buttons, links, forms and menus for actual behavior, keyboard access and understandable copy.

### P2 — Validation and quality

- [x] Run a successful production build after the latest changes. All routes compile; one existing Tailwind easing-class ambiguity warning remains.
- [x] Attempt lint and document the missing ESLint configuration; `npm run lint` requires first-time interactive setup before it can run.
- [x] Run the first no-dependency workflow tests (5 pass); expand coverage to health mortality, transfer pairs, settings and role-based flows.
- [ ] Manually exercise sign-in/demo role navigation, farm creation, flock movements, feed, production, health, sales, expenses, verification and reports across refreshes.
- [ ] Review responsive layouts at phone, tablet and desktop widths; fix overflow, focus visibility, accessible labels and reduced-motion behavior.
- [x] Run `git diff --check`; no whitespace errors. No backend paths were edited in this pass.

## Architecture and constraints

- Screens should call `frontend/src/services/index.ts`, not bind directly to a future API or add backend dependencies.
- `frontend/src/lib/simulated-data.ts` is the browser-only implementation for now. Keep existing seeded demo accounts and records; preserve their one-time migration when changing storage schema.
- Do not modify or introduce anything under `backend/`.
- No dependency installation is required or authorized by the project instructions.

## Last validation

- `npm run build`: passed after all current changes; all 42 routes generated. Tailwind reports the existing ambiguous custom easing class warning.
- `git diff --check`: passed (Git emitted line-ending normalization notices only).
- `npm run lint`: did not run because Next.js opened its first-run ESLint configuration prompt; no ESLint configuration exists in the project yet. Choose/configure a lint setup in a follow-up, then rerun.
- `npm run test:workflows`: passed (5 checks: legacy migration, flock population change, feed stock calculations, sale/expense payment bounds and malformed backup rejection).
- Browser/device review remains outstanding; expand automated workflow coverage beyond these four checks.

## Suggested next task

Add partial-payment entry and combined flock transfers first, then health treatments/editing and document workflows. Continue through opportunities/settings and the admin/institution experiences, then exercise every workflow with persisted data. Latest build passes; configure ESLint before retrying lint. Update this checklist as each item is actually completed.
